# cookiedocker-base-django-react-pgsql-nginx
Cookiedocker based in Piotr Płoński code at https://github.com/saasitive/django-react-boilerplate 
I've used his tutorials and guides at https://saasitive.com/ to build this docker-compose template.

I needed a docker infraestructure with Django, React, PostgreSQL and another classic services like nginx, Redis or Celery

I'm not going to freeze dependencies  because I think it's your work for your projects.
